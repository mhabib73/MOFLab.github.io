The content of lammpstutorials.github.io has just been published in my favorite
journal, the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science (LiveCoMS).

LiveCoMS is a diamond open access journal (free to read and free to publish)
that allows articles to evolve over time with updated versions. This was the
ideal choice for these LAMMPS tutorials, which have been constantly growing
and improving since their creation about 5 years ago.

Iâ€™m also glad to see that the number of contributors to LAMMPS tutorials
keeps expanding, now even including members of the LAMMPS development team.
