title: Advanced optical fiber fabrication
summary: "Optical fiber fabrication involves the precise creation of glass fibers that guide light with minimal loss. Using advanced techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and fiber drawing, high-purity silica preforms are heated and stretched into thin, flexible fibers that form the backbone of modern communication, sensing, and photonic technologies."

Advanced Optical Fiber Fabrication is crucial for low-loss optical fibers. By developing new fabrication techniques, we can create fibers with precisely engineered geometries and material compositions that enable lower losses, broader bandwidths, and enhanced nonlinear or sensing capabilities. The main goals of this projects are to design and fabricate next-generation fibers for high-speed data communications, ultrafast laser delivery, quantum communication, and environmental sensing â€” achieving higher performance, lower cost, and greater energy efficiency.
