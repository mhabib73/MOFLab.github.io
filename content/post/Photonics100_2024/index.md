Dr. Habib has been included Photonics100 2024 list for "The development of ultra-low loss hollow-core fibers and new light source designs".

<!--more-->
For over a decade, I’ve had the privilege of working in the ever-evolving field of photonics, advancing the development of ultra-low-loss hollow-core fibers that enable breakthroughs in long-distance communications, data center optical networks, and cloud computing.
At Florida Tech and Relativity Networks, Inc. (start up company), we continue advancing next-generation optical fibers and strengthening our impact worldwide. I’m excited to keep building this journey together with our vibrant community.
