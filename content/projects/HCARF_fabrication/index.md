        We investigate next-generation optical fiber technologies that redefine how light travels. Our work centers on innovative hollow-core fibersâ€”engineered with microscopic air channels that let light propagate faster,
        over longer distances, and with exceptionally low loss. Through advanced microstructured designs, we aim to achieve ultra-low transmission loss, minimal latency, and broad bandwidth, opening new possibilities for
        the future of high-speed communication, data networks, and beyond.
        <br><br>
        By combining theory, simulation, and experimental fabrication, we aim to understand the underlying physics of light propagation in complex fiber geometries. Our insights drive the development of practical fiber
        designs with transformative applications in AI data centers, quantum communication, ultrafast data transmission, advanced laser systems, fiber-optic sensing, and biomedical imaging.
        <br><br>
        We welcome collaborations with academic groups, industry partners, and students interested in shaping the next generation of photonic technologies.
