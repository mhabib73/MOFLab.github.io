title: Advanced optical fiber fabrication
summary: "Optical fiber fabrication involves the precise creation of glass fibers that guide light with minimal loss. Using advanced techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and fiber drawing, high-purity silica preforms are heated and stretched into thin, flexible fibers that form the backbone of modern communication, sensing, and photonic technologies."
