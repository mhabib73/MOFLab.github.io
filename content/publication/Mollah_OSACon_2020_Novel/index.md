abstract: We report a novel hollow-core asymmetric conjoined-tube anti-resonant (HC-ACTAR) fiber for efficient and low-loss THz wave guidance. The cladding tubes of the proposed HC-ACTAR fiber is formed by conjoining a half circle and a half elliptical tube and is placed in the radial direction. We observe that the proposed fiber is superior in terms of achieving low-loss and low dispersion in a wide range of frequencies than the previously reported designs. We show that our proposed HC-ACTAR fiber ensures lowest loss of 0.034 dB/m at 1 THz and marinates a low-loss window of 0.5 THz. Moreover, the proposed fiber has promising optical properties in the THz regime such as low bending loss, broadband flattened dispersion, and effective single-mode guidance, which are essential for efficient THz wave guidance.
