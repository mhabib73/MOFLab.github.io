abstract: We show that adiabatic down-conversion can be made the dominant four-wave mixing process in an anti-resonant hollow-core fiber for nearly a full octave of mid-infrared bandwidth with energy exceeding 10 μJ, allowing the generation of energetic and shapeable two-cycle pulses. A numerical study of a tapered fiber with an applied gas pressure gradient predicts the efficient conversion of a 770–860 nm near-infrared frequency band to 3–5 μm, while a linear transfer function allows pre-conversion pulse shaping and simple dispersion management. Our proposed system may prove to be useful in diverse research topics employing nonlinear spectroscopy or strong light–matter interactions.
