abstract: In this work, we present a high-pulse-energy multi-wavelength Raman laser spanning from 1.53 µm up to 2.4 µm by employing the cascaded rotational stimulated Raman scattering effect in a 5 m hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)-filled nested anti-resonant fiber, pumped by a linearly polarized Er/Yb fiber laser with a peak power of ~13 kW and pulse duration of ~7 ns  in the C-band. The developed Raman laser has distinct lines at 1683 nm, 1868 nm, 2100 nm, and 2400 nm, with pulse energies as high as 18.25 µJ, 14.4 µJ, 14.1 µJ, and 8.2 µJ, respectively. We demonstrate how the energy in the Raman lines can be controlled by tuning the  pressure from 1 bar to 20 bar.
