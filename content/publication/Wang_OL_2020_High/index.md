abstract: In this Letter, we demonstrate a high pulse energy and linearly polarized mid-infrared Raman fiber laser targeting the strongest absorption line of CO2 at 4.2 µm. This laser was generated from a hydrogen (H2)-filled antiresonant hollow-core fiber, pumped by a custom-made 1532.8 nm Er-doped fiber laser delivering 6.9 ns pulses and 11.6 kW peak power. A quantum efficiency as high as 74% was achieved, to yield 17.6 µJ pulse energy at 4.22 µm. Less than 20 bar H2 pressure was required to maximize the pulse energy since the transient Raman regime was efficiently suppressed by the long pump pulses.
