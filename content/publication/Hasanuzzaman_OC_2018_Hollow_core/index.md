abstract: A hollow-core fiber with nested anti-resonant node-free cladding tubes suitable for broadband THz guidance with low transmission losses is proposed. It is shown that the tube separation and tube thickness of the inner elements have a significant effect on the confinement loss and effective material loss of the fiber in the THz band. Using TOPAS copolymer, the proposed fiber was optimized for operation at 1 THz and it is predicted from numerical simulations that loss can be reduced to as low as 0.05 dB/m with a 0.6 THz wide dispersion flattened bandwidth.
