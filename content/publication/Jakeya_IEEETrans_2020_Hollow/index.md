abstract: In this article, a hollow core antiresonant photonic crystal fiber is analyzed for terahertz applications. A numerical analysis of the proposed fiber is first carried out to minimize coupling between the core and cladding modes. The modeling of the scaled-up and inhibited coupling fiber is carried out by means of a finite element method, which is then demonstrated using a Zeonex filament fiber, fabricated by fused deposition modeling of 3-D printing technology. The simulation is carried out to analyze both the transmission and possibility of refractometric sensing, whereas the experimental analysis is carried out using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, and supports our numerical findings, illustrating how the proposed fibers can be used for low-loss transmission of terahertz waves. The simplicity of the proposed fiber structures facilitates fabrication for a number of different transmission and sensing applications in the terahertz range.
