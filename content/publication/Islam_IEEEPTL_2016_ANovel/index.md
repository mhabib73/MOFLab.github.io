abstract: We report on the numerical design optimization of a new kind of relatively simple porous-core photonic crystal fiber (PCF) for terahertz (THz) waveguiding. A novel twist is introduced in the regular hexagonal PCF by including a diamond-shaped porous-core inside the hexagonal cladding. The numerical results obtained from an efficient finite-element method, which confirms a high birefringence of the order 10<sup>-2</sup> and low effective material loss of 0.07 cm<sup>-1</sup> at 0.7-THz operating frequency. The proposed PCF is anticipated to be useful in polarization sensitive THz appliances.
