abstract: Hollow-core anti-resonant fibers (HC-ARFs) are en route to compete with and surpass the transmission performance of standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs). Recently, nested cladding elements emerged as a key enabler in reaching ultra-low transmission losses over a wide bandwidth. However, implementing nested geometry features poses a great challenge even in the current state-of-the-art fiber fabrication technology, often leading to structural imperfections, which ultimately worsen overall fiber performance. This article provides insights into the impact of fabrication-based perturbations of the cladding elements on the transmission performance and identifies areas of highest susceptibility. The impact of random outer and nested cladding tube misalignments as well as their anisotropic deformation on the propagation loss is analyzed based on observations of experimentally fabricated fibers. A dominance of the deformation effect over the misalignment effect is observed, with higher-order modes (HOMs) being affected one order of magnitude stronger than the fundamental mode (FM). The impact on propagation loss by structural perturbations is highly wavelength dependent, ranging from negligibly small values up to loss increases of 65% and 850% for FM and HOM propagation, respectively. The investigations are directly linked to fabrication metrics and therefore pave the way for assessing, predicting, and improving the transmission quality of fabricated hollow-core fibers.
