abstract: We investigate various methods for extending the simple analytical capillary model to describe the dispersion and loss of anti-resonant hollow-core (HC) fibers without the need of detailed finite-element simulations across the desired wavelength range. This poor-man’s model can with a single fitting parameter quite accurately mimic dispersion and loss resonances and anti-resonances from full finite-element simulations. Because of the analytical basis of the model, it is easy to explore variations in core size and cladding wall thickness, and should therefore provide a valuable tool for numerical simulations of the ultrafast nonlinear dynamics of gas-filled HC fibers.
