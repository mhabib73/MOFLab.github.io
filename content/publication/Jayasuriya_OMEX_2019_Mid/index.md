abstract: This work reports on the fabrication and subsequent supercontinuum generation in a Ge-As-Se-Te/Ge-As-Se core/clad chalcogenide step-index fiber with an elliptical-core and an ultra-high numerical aperture of 1.88 ± 0.02 from 2.5 - 15 µm wavelength. The fiber has very low transmission loss of < 2 dB/m from 5-11 µm and a minimum loss of 0.72 ± 0.04 dB/m at 8.56 µm. Supercontinuum spanning from 2.1 µm to 11.5 µm with an average power of ∼6.5 mW was achieved by pumping a ∼16 cm fiber with a minor/major axis core diameter of 4.2/5.2 µm with 250 fs pulses at 4.65 µm wavelength and a repetition rate of 20.88 MHz. The effect of the elliptical-core was investigated by means of mechanical rotation of the fiber relative to the linear pump polarization, and it was found to cause a shift in the supercontinuum spectral edges by several hundred nanometers.
