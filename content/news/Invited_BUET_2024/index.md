Title: Recent Advances in Next-generation Optical Fibers: Applications and Beyond

Abstract: Over the last 25 years, the field of fiber optics has experienced remarkable progress, contributing to the widespread expansion of the Internet and bringing about transformative changes in various domains such as quantum communication and sensing, industrial manufacturing, directed energy, non-invasive laser surgery, early cancer detection, optical microscopy, and biomedical sensing. Undoubtedly, one of the most significant innovations in this field is the development of hollow-core anti-resonant fiber (HC-ARF). HC-ARF offers several promising and unrivaled features such as exceptionally well-confined photons inside the core offering an ideal platform for studying prolonged, well-controlled and diffraction free light-matter interaction in Raman active and inactive gases; low-loss, multi-octave wide transmission, adjustable pressure dispersion; and can tolerate GW of power, not possible to obtain in any waveguides or fibers. This talk will cover the most recent advanced optical fibers for applications in high-energy laser delivery system, ultrafast non-linear dynamics, and beyond.
